### How I used git during my workterm
* git clone [link to repository]

#### you can practice using these steps
* git checkout -b [name of branch]
* [make changes to code]
* git stash
* git checkout master
* git pull
* git checkout [name of same branch]
* git pull
* git stash pop
* git add [file]
* git commit
* git push origin master

### useful git command (feel free to add more)
- git stash list (see a list of what you stashed)-
- git status (to see what files you changed or added)
- git checkout -- [file name] (revert changes you made that isn't added yet)
- git branch (check which branch you're working on)
- git checkout [branch] change branch
- git add (this is like writing the changes but not yet pressing ctrl-s to git)
- git commit (this is equivalent to crtl-s)
- git commit --amend (if you want to add more to something you just commited, make sure to add the change id)
